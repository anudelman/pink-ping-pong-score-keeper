# Pink Ping Pong Score Keeper

## Project Name: Ping Pong Score Keeper

## Objective: Develop a simple web application that helps users keep track of scores during a ping pong match.

## Features:

- Display the current score of each player.
- Buttons to increase the score for each player.
- A button to reset the game.
- A dropdown to change the maximum score.

### A simple Ping Pong Score Keeper application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to challenge myself to create a basic interface, style it, and implement interactive functionality for score tracking and resetting. In the future I might enhance this project by adding features like win detection as a UI elemnt (e.g. - A dialog VS currently in console.log), additional micro-interactions, theming options, adding player names, scoreboard history and more.
