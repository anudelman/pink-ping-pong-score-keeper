## Objective: Develop a simple web application that helps users keep track of scores during a ping pong match.

### A simple Ping Pong Score Keeper application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was assigned as part of Colt Steele's 2023 Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I challenged myself by taking a slightly different approach in creating a basic interface, styling it, and implementing interactive functionality for score tracking and resetting. In the future I might enhance this project by adding features like win detection as a UI elemnt (e.g. - A dialog VS currently printing to the console), additional micro-interactions, theming options, adding player names, scoreboard history and more.
